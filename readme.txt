This plugin takes the rss fields (XML API) available from your Oracle Aragon-eRH and convert it to a list you can use in a widget or a post.

== Description ==

You can sync Aragon-eRH manually or using a bulk process. The plugin will technically work with any XML feed that uses the format: rss > channel > item > link, title, description, pubDate.
The widget height can be set from the widget screen and allows you to scroll the content like a vertical ticker.
